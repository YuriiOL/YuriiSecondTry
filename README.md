How to use?

When you selected a picture, press the green button "Дале".

3. On third step you decide what text you want in your picture.
When you are ready, press the green button "Дале".
4. Step 4 you decide what color of fingerprints you want (if you chose more than 3 colors price add 30, and more than 6 colors price add 30 again).
When you selected a colors, press the green button "В корзину". 
5.After step 4, you will receive a notification that your order has been placed.
In console you can see your choice.

This code still have a few bugs
1. I use imports in my code to make it more nicely,
because of that imports and vanilla js you can run this code only with using Live Server (other ways to run code doesn't work).
2. Inposible return to the previous step.
